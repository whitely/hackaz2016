  <p>Our motivation was simple: we don't know what we don't know. We had an idea - graphs reveal information more readily than text. To many people around the world, long-form English proofs can be difficult to read (English isn't everyone's native language). Graphs are visually easy to comprehend regardless of language fluency or mathematical background.</p>

  <p>We hope to reveal what we (as humans) don't know about math. Many frayed but disjoint edges branching off of one node indicate that a theorem has led to many others but that not much research has been done between the topics. The presence of tight clusters with little outgoing edges indicate the possibility of connecting that field to another. Similar structures indicate places where mathematical concepts may be connected on a deeper level than we currently believe.</p>

  <p>Our goal is to take what we've built and expand it. We would like to see this approach brought to a larger corpus both inside and outside of mathematics. What might a computer science student learn from such visualization? What might others?</p>

  <ul>We are <em>open</em>:
    <li>We've built our technology stack on open-source software</li>
    <li>We are licensing our code under the GNU AGPL 3.0</li>
    <li>We are committed to <a href="http://mirror.reflect.wiki">re-hosting</a> and making our <a href="http://markdown.reflect.wiki">datasets</a> available to the public</li>
    <li>Our data is collected from public collaboration</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>We are <em>accessible</em>:
    <li>We use standards-compliant technology, and make all of our <a href="https://github.com/whitely/hackaz2016/blob/master/markup">data collection</a> and <a href="https://github.com/whitely/hackaz2016/tree/master/gengen">processing tools</a> publicly available.</li>
    <li>We are implementing accessibility features on our website, and already have some.</li>
    <li>We have re-hosted all of our data so it is publicly visible to those who may have wiki sites censored.</li>
    <li>We are committed to improving and continuing this project moving forward from Hack Arizona.</li>
  </ul>
